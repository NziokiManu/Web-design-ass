        <p>What is a Wildlife Sanctuary?
        <br>
        A wildlife sanctuary is an area where animal habitats and their surroundings are protected from any sort of disturbance. The capturing, killing and poaching of animals is strictly prohibited in these regions.
        They aim at providing a comfortable living to the animals. India has beautiful wildlife sanctuaries, with dense forests, large rivers, high and beautiful mountains. Few of the these in India are mentioned here.
         
        <h4>Importance of Wildlife Sanctuaries</h4>
        There are a number of reasons for establishing wildlife sanctuaries. Some of the reasons are listed below:
        
        The wildlife sanctuaries are established to protect the endangered species.
        
        It is quite difficult to always relocate the animals from their natural habitat, therefore, protecting them in their natural environment is advantageous.
        
        The endangered species are specially monitored in the wildlife sanctuaries. If they reproduce and grow in number while under protection, few specimens can be kept for breeding in the conservation parks for their survival.
        
        Biologist activities and researches are permitted in the wildlife sanctuaries so that they can learn about the animals living there.
        
        A few sanctuaries take in injured and abandoned animals and rehabilitate them to health before releasing them in the forest.
        
        Wildlife sanctuaries preserve the endangered species and protect them from humans and predators.
        
        <h4>Protection of Endangered Species</h4>
        Many species of plants and animals are on the verge of extinction. Such creatures are conserved in the wildlife sanctuaries. Various sanctuaries have been established such as the Fleurieu peninsula sanctuary is maintained to protect sheoak habitat for glossy black cockatoos.
        
        <h4>Conservation of Biodiversity</h4>
        The landowners of a wildlife sanctuary are involved in:
        
        Production and distribution of electricity.
        
        Horticulture, grazing and farming enterprises
        
        Wine production
        
        Organic horticulture
        
        <h4>Ecotourism</h4>
        Many sanctuaries are involved in ecotourism. They offer accommodation, tour guides, nature walks, etc.
        
        <h4>Education and Public use</h4>
        The sanctuaries that are created on public land are involved in public use along with the conservation of biodiversity. For eg., golf courses, picnic areas, lakes for boating and swimming.
        
        Thus we know, that a wildlife sanctuary is one of the finest ways of preserving the endangered species.
